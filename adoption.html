            All These Budgies are very loved and we only wish they go to homes who have done their utmost research. We do provide some information on how to cater to a budgie but do not rely on information from a single site. As far as you are aware, the site could be misinformed and wrong, so make sure to compare information from multiple sites before seeing it as truth.
