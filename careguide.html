                <p>It's highly suggested to get at least <strong>two birds</strong>, as this will significantly enhance their happiness and overall well-being, especially during times when you may be absent for extended periods. Birds are social creatures that thrive on interaction, both with their owners and with other birds. Having a companion can prevent loneliness, reduce stress, and promote more natural behaviors, such as play and socializing. While having two birds is particularly important if you are frequently away from home, it's not an absolute requirement if you are committed to providing a lot of time, attention, and care to a single bird. A single bird can also be happy and healthy, provided that you can engage with it regularly through near constant daily: playtime, training, and social interaction.</p>

                <p>Contrary to popular belief, seeds are not suitable for an everyday meal. A balanced diet includes veggies, fruits, and pellets. Rotate the food daily and offer veggies every other day. You can give a small portion of seeds as a treat. Remember, budgies cannot eat: uncooked potatoes, avocado, onions, garlic, dairy products, fruit pits, fruit seeds, elderberries, rhubarb leaves, processed foods, alcohol, and chocolate. Favorite treats are millet seeds. Again, these are not an every day food it is just a great treat for training. Seeds are another good option. Budgies favorite foods will vary depending on the budgies preference.</p>

                <p>Providing birds with a spacious area to play and live is essential. Choose a comfortable, large cage for your budgies to play and sleep in. A travel cage will never be suitable for a bird to live in. I personally like to make sure I get one I feel may be a bit too large. Clean the cage weekly with no chemicals and add toys to keep them happy, along with natural wood perches to support their foot health. Birds also need time outside the cage whenever possible. Do not force the bird out of the cage, let it have time to adjust to you and it's surroundings. The cage is not the only area that needs consistent cleaning. Birds have small lungs same with any small bird. Thus dust is a threat to their breathing. Make sure if you're in your space regularly it is cleaned each week at the latest to the point there is minimal dust if any.</p>

                <p>To help two birds bond, introduce them in a neutral space where neither feels territorial. Allow them to see and hear each other before introducing them physically. Monitor their interactions closely at first, and offer treats to both birds during the process. Encourage playtime together and provide ample space for them to socialize while ensuring they have separate spaces to retreat to when needed. Birds are able to bond with other bird species though this can be more of a challange seeing as birds can't understand birds of different species. Do note a bird might never take a liking to another bird. Make sure you are prepared in case this happens.</p>

                <img src="https://birdadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Taming-Parakeet.jpeg" alt="Budgie and Owner">
                <p>To help budgies feel comfortable with you, spend time near their cage, talking softly and offering treats. Gradually introduce your hand into their space, allowing them to approach at their own pace. Use positive reinforcement or treats to encourage them to come closer or hop onto your finger. Many birds will inform you they are done training with body language; once they start preening, or losing interest, training is over. Patience is key; every bird adjusts differently, so create a trusting environment and avoid sudden movements or noise.</p>

                <p>Birds can contract diseases easily and most commonly is <b>not</b> the owners fault. A newly bought budgie is commonly uninterested in eating and that is completely normal and healthy just give them time. If this persists enquire with a vet. Plucking is typically caused by: Stress, Hormones, or Boredom, but can also be caused by parisites, which why it is best to enquire with a vet after obvious feather loss is shown. Any time a budgie has waste buildup on their feathers, that is a very common sign of illness. When a budgie is sick make sure to quarantine it from any other birds.</p>
